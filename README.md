# Google Web Clone

This project is a web clone of the famous google.com, created to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. 
The goal was to build the entire website from scratch without relying on any external frameworks. Instead, 
I utilized CSS flexbox and grid layouts to achieve a responsive and visually appealing design.
