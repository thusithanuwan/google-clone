# Google Web Clone

The Google Web Clone is a project developed to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This web application serves as a replica of the famous google.com, aiming to replicate its design and functionalities.

The primary objective of this project was to build the entire website from scratch, without relying on any external frameworks. Instead, I utilized CSS flexbox and grid layouts to create a responsive and visually appealing design, closely resembling the original Google website.

## Key Features

- **Search Functionality**: The search tab is seamlessly linked with a programmable search engine provided by Google. Users can search for anything they desire, just like on the original web page.

- **Google Services Integration**: Essential Google services, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, and news, are thoughtfully integrated into the web clone for quick access.

The Google Web Clone utilizes the following technologies:
